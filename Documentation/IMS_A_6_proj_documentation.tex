	\maketitle
	
	\noindent For this project we have tried to work as a group as much as possible. We managed to work singularly and together and all the choices reflect the group decisions.
	
	\section{User Stories}
	
	A new student of the Free University of Bolzano arrives in the city. He does not have any friends, and neither has been in South Tyrol before. However, he wants to discover the beauty of the villages and the environment in which he will live for some years. He does not want to visit alone and does not have any information regarding what to see and how to get there.

	
	\section{Implementation and Technologies}	
	In the implementation of this website the technologies that we use are : Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, JQuery, PHP, MySQL.\\
	We used also some external libraries like:
Lightbox, PHPMailer, Mail Scheduler (by Chintan Patel).

	\section{Development Process}

	\section{Testing}
	The main focus feature that we tested the most was the responsive design, since we wanted our website to be responsive in any environment. After having tested all the methods of the back end and we were sure that they would respond with the result that we wanted to we focused on the responsive front end. After a lot of testing, we can say that we achieved our goal since our website is responsive to any size of screen and it works on  all the main web browsers such as : Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari,Microsoft Edge and even on Internet Explorer.
